Compile the socket program as mentioned below
`gcc [program] -o [executable_name] -Wno-implicit`

Compile the client_soc program as mentioned below
`x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc client_soc.c -o client.exe -lws2_32`

        specify `-w` option while compiling the program to remove potencial warning messages.
        defender not detecting while testing the reverse shell.
